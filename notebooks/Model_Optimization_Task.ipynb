    "\t1. You can use flask or fast api in python and create seperate POST endpoints for both base and optimized model\n",

    "\n",
    "\t1. Add Kafka topics to both the endpoints in the previous task in such a way so that you are consuming the request for \n",
    "both the models in a seperate topic and sending the responses back in seperate topic. (eg topics : model1-in, model1-out, model2-in , model2-out)\n",
    "\t2. Create a docker-compose file in such a way it can host a docker based kafka broker as well as your image from previous task.\n",
    "Submit the compose file for evaluation.(Make sure to test the compose file for any hiccups before submitting).\n",
